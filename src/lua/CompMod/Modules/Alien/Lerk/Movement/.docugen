Alien.Lerk.Movement
Increase strafe force to 8.3 from 7
Air friction value remains equal to vanilla friction (0.08) for 0.64 seconds after flapping
After 0.75 seconds, friction is scaled linearly from 0.08 to 0.5 over 3.25 seconds (total of 4 seconds)
This change minimizes the effectiveness of silent Lerk ambushes. A lerk will have to flap in order to quickly catch a marine
Lerk movement mid-flight while flapping often is unaffected
