Alien.Upgrades.Scavenger
Added new Trait Scavenger to the Crag hive
When a Marine is killed their lifeforce is scavenged by the attacking lifeforms
Lifeforms will heal proportionally based on how much damage they contributed to kill the Marine, up to a maximum value
Max Heal Values
>Skulk: 30
>Gorge: 50
>Lerk: 60
>Fade: 120
>Onos: 300
The max heal values will increase with Biomass to scale in effectiveness as the game progresses
The heal is applied in 3 chunks over 5 seconds
>In other words: one third of the total heal is applied every 1.67s three times
Only the damage contributed through primary attacks will count towards the heal bonus
Only damage done in the last 10 seconds will count towards the heal bonus
