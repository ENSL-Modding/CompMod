--    The base class for all GUI things in the new system.  By default is invisible.
--  
--  Parameters (* = required)
--      align                   Equivalent to calling AlignTop(), AlignCenter(), etc.  Valid values
--                              are:
--                                  topLeft,        top,        topRight,
--                                  left,           center,     right,
--                                  bottomLeft,     bottom,     bottomRight,
--      angle
--      anchor
--      color
--      hotSpot
--      opacity
--      position
--      rotationOffset
--      size
--      scale
--      debugLogProperties      Takes a set (table of [key] = true) of property names that will be
--                              logged and traced every time Set() is called for them.  Useful for
--                              tracking down where bad data is coming from.
--      
--  Properties
--      Anchor                          The location of the origin relative to the parent, in
--                                      normalized coordinates (normalized to parent's scaled
--                                      size).  Default is upper-left corner (0, 0).
--      
--      Angle                           The counter-clockwise rotation, in radians, of this object.
--      
--      BlendTechnique                  How the root GUIItem of this object will be blended when
--                                      rendered.  Choices are:
--                                          GUIItem.Default (unpremultiplied blend)
--                                          GUIItem.Add
--                                          GUIItem.Multiply
--                                          GUIItem.Set (no blending, src overwrites dst)
--                                          GUIItem.Premultiplied
--      
--      ClearsStencilBuffer             True/False, sets whether or not this item clears the
--                                      stencil buffer when it renders.
--      
--      Color                           Sets the color of this GUIItem.  By default, color is
--                                      (0, 0, 0, 0), so this GUIItem is not visible, but its
--                                      children are unaffected by the color.
--      
--      CropMax                         Sets the bottom-right corner of the scissor region for this
--                                      item, in normalized coordinates (normalized to the object's
--                                      size and scale).  By default, items do not use cropping,
--                                      but it is enabled whenever CropMin or CropMax are changed.
--                                      By default it is (0, 0), (which, if cropping were enabled,
--                                      would cause this item to not render).
--                                      When cropping is enabled, children inherit and refine the
--                                      zone (never expand).  If a parent object is completely
--                                      cropped away, none of the children will render either.
--      
--      CropMin                         Sets the top-left corner of the scissor region for this
--                                      item, in normalized coordinates (normalized to the object's
--                                      size and scale).  By default, items do not use cropping,
--                                      but it is enabled whenever CropMin or CropMax are changed.
--                                      By default, it is (0, 0).
--                                      When cropping is enabled, children inherit and refine the
--                                      zone (never expand).  If a parent object is completely
--                                      cropped away, none of the children will render either.
--      
--      DropShadowColor                 Sets the color of the drop shadow effects.  Default is a
--                                      75% opaque black.
--      
--      DropShadowEnabled               Enables/disables the drop shadow effect for text.  Disabled
--                                      by default.  Has no effect on non-text items.
--      
--      DropShadowOffset                Sets the offset of the drop shadow effect, in screen-space
--                                      pixels.  The drop shadow is applied after scaling, so the
--                                      shadow will be at a consistent distance regardless of the
--                                      GUIItem's scale.
--      
--      FontName                        Sets the font file path used to render text with this.
--                                      It is HIGHLY recommended you use GUIText or GUIParagraph to
--                                      display text, rather than the raw GUIItem functionality.
--                                      The aforementioned classes automatically handle font size
--                                      selection and scaling.
--      
--      HotSpot                         The location of the origin of this object, in normalized
--                                      coornates (normalized to this object's scaled size).
--                                      Default is upper-left corner (0, 0).
--      
--      InheritsParentAlpha             True/false.  If true, children's alpha channel (not RGB)
--                                      will be multiplied by the alpha channel of the parent.
--                                      NOTE:  Calling GetColor() WILL reflect this inheritance,
--                                      but values passed to SetColor() will NOT be reflected.
--                                      Example:
--                                          Object A is a parent to object B.
--                                          A:SetColor(1, 1, 1, 0.5)
--                                          B:SetColor(1, 1, 1, 0.8)
--                                          
--                                          B:SetInheritsParentAlpha(false)
--                                          result of B:GetColor() is (1, 1, 1, 0.8)
--                                          
--                                          B:SetInheritsParentAlpha(true)
--                                          result of B:GetColor() is (1, 1, 1, 0.4)
--                                          
--                                          B:SetInheritsParentAlpha(false)
--                                          result of B:GetColor() is (1, 1, 1, 0.8)
--                                          
--                                          B:SetInheritsParentAlpha(true)
--                                          B:SetColor(1, 1, 1, 0.6)
--                                          result of B:GetColor() is (1, 1, 1, 0.3) -- NOT 0.6
--                                      NOTE: This is an engine behavior.  The lua layer (what
--                                      you're currently reading) separates Opacity and Color, but
--                                      combines them when setting the engine (GUIItem) value.  This
--                                      means that the alpha value being inherited is the parent's
--                                      alpha * the parent's opacity.  If the parent GUIObject is
--                                      just a locater object, it will have 0 alpha in the Color
--                                      value, making all children set to inherit alpha invisible.
--                                      In other words... this isn't all that useful here, and is
--                                      only provided for completeness.
--      
--      InheritsParentScaling           True/false.  If true, children will inherit their parent's
--                                      absolute scale before applying their own when calculating
--                                      final transform.  HOWEVER, unlike InheritsParentAlpha, the
--                                      values of Scale are always local.  In other words, this
--                                      property will never cause GetScale() to return a different
--                                      value, as Scale is always local.  To get the absolute scale
--                                      of an object, use the GetAbsoluteScale() method.  Just be
--                                      aware that it is more expensive.
--      
--      InheritsParentStencilSettings   True/false.  If true, children will inherit their parent's
--                                      stencil settings.
--      
--      IsStencil                       True/false.  Whether or not the item will be rendered into
--                                      the stencil buffer.
--      
--      Layer                           Integer describing the relative ordering of this object
--                                      amongst the parent, and amongst its siblings. Default is 0.
--                                      If positive or 0, object will render on top of its parent,
--                                      and will be considered for interactions before the parent.
--                                      If negative, object will render below parent, and will only
--                                      be considered for interactions after the parent.
--      
--      Opacity                         The opacity of the object.  This is applied on top of the
--                                      alpha value of the Color property.
--
--      Position                        The position of the object relative to the parent.  More
--                                      precisely, the offset of the object's hot spot relative to
--                                      the anchor point.
--      
--      RotationOffset                  The normalized offset of the rotation pivot point (the
--                                      point that the object rotates around for the Angle
--                                      property.  Default is upper-left corner (0, 0).
--      
--      Scale                           Local scale of the object.  Default is (1, 1).
--      
--      Shader                          Sets the shader used to render the GUIItem.  Default is
--                                      "shaders/GUIBasic.surface_shader".
--      
--      Size                            Local size of the GUIObject before scaling.
--      
--      SnapsToPixels                   True/false.  Set whether or not to make text snap to
--                                      pixels.  Snapping to pixels preserves some sharpness by
--                                      avoiding the bilinear interpolation, but at the cost of
--                                      smoothness when animating, and less precision for kerning.
--      
--      StencilFunc                     Sets the stencil mode which will change how pixels are
--                                      rendered into the stencil buffer.  Options are:
--                                          GUIItem.Always, -- default
--                                          GUIItem.Equal,
--                                          GUIItem.NotEqual
--      
--      Text                            The text to draw for this item (if text is enabled).  If
--                                      this item is not a text item, this field is unused (but can
--                                      still be used for storage if necessary).
--      
--      Texture                         The filepath of the texture to use for this item.
--      
--      Visible                         True/false if this object is visible.  If false, neither
--                                      this object nor any of its children will be rendered or
--                                      considered for interactions.
--  
--  Events
--      OnDestroy           Fires just before the object is destroyed.  NOTE: When this event
--                          fires, all child objects of this object will have already been
--                          destroyed.
--                              thisObject -- the object being destroyed.
--      
--      OnChildRemoved      Fires when a child object is removed.
--                              removedItem -- the item that was just removed.
--      
--      OnChildAdded        Fires when a child object is added.
--                              addedItem -- the item that was just added.
--                              params -- list of parameters (required by some
--                                  layouts).
--      
--      OnParentChanged     Fires when this object's parent is changed. (Does not detect further-
--                          removed ancestors, only parent.)
--      
--      OnMouseHover        Fires every frame that the mouse is hovering over this object, with no
--                          other objects between this object and the mouse cursor.  Only fires if
--                          this object is setup to receive cursor events (See
--                          GUIObject:ListenForCursorInteractions()).  Note that this does not
--                          always work.  Some widgets will override the basic events without forwarding.
--      
--      OnMouseEnter        Fires when the mouse begins hovering over this object, and no other
--                          objects are between this object and the mouse cursor.  Only fires if
--                          this object is setup to receive cursor events (See
--                          GUIObject:ListenForCursorInteractions()).  Note that this does not
--                          always work.  Some widgets will override the basic events without
--                          forwarding.
--      
--      OnMouseExit         Fires when the mouse, which had been hovering over this object with no
--                          other objects between this object and the mouse cursor -- is no longer
--                          hovering over this object.  Every OnMouseExit event will have had an

--                          after having been clicked down on earlier (firing OnMouseClick).
--                          Only fires if this object is setup to receive cursor events (See
--                          GUIObject:ListenForCursorInteractions()).

--                          but only after having been clicked down on earlier (firing
--                          OnMouseClick).

--                          events (See GUIObject:ListenForWheelInteractions()).
--                              up -- true/false the wheel movement was up (otherwise down).
--      
--      OnKey               Fires when a keyboard key is pressed down or released, and is the top-
--                          most visible listener.  Only fires if this object is setup to receive
--                          keyboard events (See GUIObject:ListenForKeyInteractions()).
--                              key -- a value from the InputKey set.

--                              Otherwise up.
--      
--      OnCharacter         Fires when a character is typed in by the user.  This will only occur
--                          when the object is listening for characters (See
--                          GUIObject:ListenForCharacters()).
--                              character -- the character that is received, as a UTF-8 string (eg

--      
--      OnOutsideClick      Called when the object is modal and the mouse is clicked down outside
--                          the object. (See GUIObject:SetModal()).
--      
--      OnOutsideWheel      Called when the object is modal and the mouse wheel is rolled when the
